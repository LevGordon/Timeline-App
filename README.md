# Timeline-App
An app which allows the user to create and follow a timeline towards achieving a goal.



Main app will need specific information before the timeline can be created. Such as:

End goal
End goal date (optional, changeable later)
Amount of participants in the achieving of that goal. Allows for color-coding events and can be optional and added later.



The app will present a timeline which:

Allows the user to modify the end goal date at any time. This means that all of the events correspond and are determined by the settable end date.
Allows the user to create, modify, duplicate and delete events.
Events that occur on the same day need to be accurately displayed either stacked or within an openable container.


Each event will have the following features:

A delete button
A modify button
A copy button
A paste button
A title
A text body
A date (changeable)
A colored background representative of the person in charge of the event
A checkbox to indicate completion
