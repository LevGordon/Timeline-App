# Timeline-App
An app which allows the user to create and follow a timeline towards achieving a goal.

REFER TO PROMOTIONTIMELINE.png for an image sketch.


Main app will need specific information before the timeline can be created. Such as:

- End goal
- End goal date (optional, changeable later)
- Amount of participants in the achieving of that goal. Allows for color-coding events and can be optional and added later.


The app will present a timeline which:

- Allows the user to modify the end goal date at any time. This means that all of the events correspond and are determined by the settable end date.
- Allows the user to create, modify, duplicate and delete events.
- Events that occur on the same day need to be accurately displayed either stacked or within an openable container.
 


Each event will have the following features:

- A delete button
- A modify button
- A copy button
- A paste button
- A title
- A text body
- A date (changeable)
- A colored background representative of the person in charge of the event
- A checkbox to indicate completion
- A button which allows an explanatory bubble to be created. 

Each explanatory bubble will have the following features:

- A text box with the explanation
- A link button which allows the user to "link" the explanation bubble to multiple events. "Linking" an explanation to an event will draw a line connecting the two.



Additional features I consider implementing:

- Making the timeline zoomable 
- Ability to save file as PDF
